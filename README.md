    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ./URL-Shortener-App
    npm install
    ```

3. Goto the backend directory

4. Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```bash
    DB_URL=<your-mongodb-database-url>
    JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
    SESSION_SECRET=<your-session-secret>
    PORT=4001
    BASE_URL=http://localhost:4001
    SHORT_URL_PREFIX=http://localhost:4001/u 
    EMAIL_HOST=<your-email-host>, e.g. smtp.gmail.com
    EMAIL_PORT=<your-email-port>, e.g. 587
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your-email-host-user>, e.g. john@gmail.com
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<your-email-host-password>, e.g. btvpykqmgtrpeukj
    FRONTEND_URL=<your-frontend-webapp-url>
    ```

    Example .env file:
      ```bash
      DB_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      JWT_SECRET=secret
      SESSION_SECRET=secret
      PORT=4001
      BASE_URL=http://localhost:4001
      SHORT_URL_PREFIX=http://localhost:4001/u
      EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
